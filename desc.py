*Unknown*
Their once was a time I was like you, fellow player.
I was bound here since my arrival unable to deafen the abominations the Mainframe could connive. 
One day, this fabricated world will seek its own end,
weather that be from another trapped soul or the fault of RKIS itself. 
Don't fret, your first attempts will stand no ground against the entity that lies before you.
Each loss is another chance for improvement. 
When we players lose to this ever binding entity we could grasp at the very fibers, RKIS made the mainframe from. 
I've heard rumors of a shop where you can spend these fibers to improver your arsenal.
That's all I know, got forth and seek my fallen friends.

*Coal Miner*
*ACHGH THOO* [Spit hits the ground near you]
You, their young feller, walk yourself this way. My eyes halfta adjust and sorts.
Ever since that day, the sky seems too dark to find.
[A decrepit man lay in front of you. He seems thin as the surrounding air.]
Won'tcha turn me over so I can get a good look at ya.  Don'tcha wana help one of the elderly.
Innit strange how were trapped in a place that has no hand in the real world. 
We're stuck like a rolly polly in them, their shag carpet. Never to leave or see the real sky ever again. 
I'm rotting worse than a buffalo in a desert storm.
 This dammed thing won't let me pass on.
I'm the only one who all most made the darned thing cap size.

 I may be held by ARKIS but it shows me the  future.
I can see it clearly ; Hardships faced unnecessarily ,lay in the calm for as long as you can imagine a place on you can let your mind wander.'''

You lack the knowledge and power to defeat me. 
You are but a reflection of the media.  
The people don't see me as a hero but as the villain who abuses the system ,

But today we see who is strongest!

Paywall : The obstacle you have met is an immovable object.
You will lose all that your miserable soul has earned.

With the new world I have created everything will be more efficient .

If you couldn’t tell, this is a card game. You can explore the world for story dialog with npcs represented by the character “8“.
By pressing “e “ in the open world, you start a boss battle.
Once you enter a boss battle, the boss will attack you first after you will be prompted to select a card from your deck to attack the boss with.
You can upgrade these cards with points gotten after dying or beating a boss to the boss by entering the shop, giving you the ability to improve.
