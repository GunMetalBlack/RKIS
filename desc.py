*Unknown*

Their once was a time I was like you, fellow player. I was bound here since my arrival unable to deafen the abominations the Mainframe could connive. One day, this fabricated world will seek its own end, weather that be from another trapped soul or the fault of RKIS itself. 

Don't fret, your first attempts will stand no ground against the entity that lies before you.

Each loss is another chance for improvement. 

When we players lose to this ever binding entity we could grasp at the very fibers, RKIS made the mainframe from. 

 I've heard rumors of a shop where you can spend these fibers to improver your arsenal.

That's all I know, got forth and seek my fallen friends.

*ACHGH THOO* [Spit hits the ground near you]

You, their young feller, walk yourself this way. My eyes halfta adjust and sorts. Ever since that day, the sky seems too dark to find. 

[A decrepit man lay in front of you. He seems thin as the surrounding air. ]

Won'tcha turn me over so I can get a good look at ya.  Don'tcha wana help one of the elderly.  Innit strange how were trapped in a place that has no hand in the real world. 

We're stuck like a rolly polly in them, their shag carpet. Never to leave or see the real sky ever again. I'm rotting worse than a buffalo in a desert storm. This dammed thing won't let me pass on.

I'm the only one who all most made the darned thing cap size.
